		<p><b>Summary</b></p>
		<p>Asset monitor displays information about host groups and hosts.  It gives a quick snapshot of what types of hosts are in your host groups and what type of hardware/software those hosts have configured.  It also provides a change log which allows you track host changes from a historical perspective.  The host information is gathered on each host and pushed to the server.  This is done once every day since the data gathered is fairly static in nature.</p>
		<p><b>Host Group Assets</b></p>
		<p>Shows how many hosts and the breakdown of host type for every host group.  You can also toggle and get a quick host view which show the hostname, IP address, OS, and CPU model for every host.  If more information is needed you can drill into each host.</p>

		<p><b>Host Assets</b></p>
		<p>Displays detailed information about a host.  The following things are displayed:</p>
		<p>CPU Model - Shows the model number of the cpu(s)  for a given host.</p>
		<p>CPU Speed - Shows the speed of the cpu(s) in MHZ for a given host.</p>
		<p>Number of CPUs - Shows the number of cpu(s) in a given host.  Note: with technologies such as hyper threading and multi-core cpu(s), perfstat display's logical not physical cpu's.</p>
		<p>Total Memory - Shows the total physical memory installed in a given host.</p>
		<p>OS - Shows the os name for a given host.  Note: this is a generic os name perfstat uses for host categorization.</p>
		<p>OS Version - Shows the os version a given host is running.</p>
		<p>Kernel Version - Shows the kernel version a given os is running.  Note: Unix only.</p>
		<p>Service Pack - Shows the service pack a given host is running.  Note: Windows only.</p>
		<p>Patches - Shows a list of all the patches installed on a given host.  This is very handy for tracking security vulnerablility and other critical os fixes.</p>

		<p><b>Change Log</b></p>
		<p>A log for every host used to document and provide a historical view of all changes.  This is a very useful feature in an environemnt where more than one system administrator is responsible for a given host.  It can be used to document maintenances, software upgrades/additions, hardware upgrades/additions, and failures.  It it similar to a medical record for every host.  A system administrator can go back and look at the history of that host which often helps explain things that are occuring in the present.</p>
