		<p><b>Summary</b></p>
		<p>Host Groups are the logical groupings of hosts within the PerfStat application.  They are configured by users and each user can configure it's own Host Groups as well as share them to other users of the application.  Host Groups allow a user to customize the PerfStat application to their liking.  Since both status and performance data is pushed up from the host level to the group level, organizing Host Groups becomes a very powerful asset within the PerfStat application.</p>
