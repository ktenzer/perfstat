# events-disable configuration file
# This file is used to suppress event logging of certain or all
# services.  The format is as follows:
#
# Format: <hostname>:<service1>:<service2>
#
# The (*) wildcard can be used to cover all metrics if you want to 
# completely disable event logging for a given host.
#
# Below is a real worl example:
#
# myhost.mydomain.com:cpu:mem:io
#
# In the above example event logging for cpu, mem, and io would be
# completely suppressed.
