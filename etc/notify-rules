# notify-rules configuration file
#
# This file is used to setup an alerting policy using smtp
# The format is as follows:
#
# Format: hostname:<Hour Range>:<Day Range>:<metric1,metric2...>:<email1,email2...>
#
# The Hour Range is 0 to 23. If multiple ranges are used they 
# must be seperated by commas. The (*) wildcard can be used to 
# cover then entire range or all of the hours in the day. 
#
# The Day Range is 1 to 31. If multiple ranges are used they 
# must be seperated by commas. The (*) wildcard can be used 
# to cover then entire range or all of the days in the month.
#
# Metrics must also be seperated by commas.  The (*) wildcard 
# can be used to cover then entire range or all of the metrics.
#
# Email addresses are a comma separated list of email addresses.
# You can have one or more.
# 
# Below is a real world example:
#
# myhost.mydomain.com:8-11,13-17:*:mem,cpu,fs,io:myemail1@mydomain.com,myemail2.mydomain.com
#
# In the above example myhost would send alerts for mem, cpu, fs, 
# and io during the hours of 8am-11am and 1pm-5pm on everyday of
# the month to the listed email addresses.
